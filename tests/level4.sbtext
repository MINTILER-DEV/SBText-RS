sprite Stage
  when flag clicked
    broadcast ["start"]
  end
end

sprite Enemy
  var health

  when I receive ["start"]
    set [health] to (50)
  end

  when this sprite clicked
    change [health] by (-5)

    if <([health]) <= (0)> then
      say ("enemy defeated")
    else
      say ([health])
    end
  end
end
